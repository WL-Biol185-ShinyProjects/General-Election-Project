# General-Election-Project

Motivation: The 2020 Presidential Election is about a year away from taking place. Our application is designed to create key visuals to put context behind past elections by states, counties, and parties. The app then contains a model that predicts the likelihood either party wins based on the number of electoral votes obtained by each party. The prediction model uses a sampling by randomly assigning unselected states as going one way or the other. The sample is run 1000 times and then we take the percentage in which the sample results in either side winning.
